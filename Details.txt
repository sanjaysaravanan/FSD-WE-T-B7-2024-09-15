  3. What is css? 

      HTML: Skeleton of a webpage

      CSS - Casecading Style Sheet or **Style Provider/Skin Makeup for the Skeleton**
        language used to style a webpage using CSS selectors

        property & value:
          has a lot of specific proerties with specified property values
        
        css selectors:
          body {
            // property: value; for the body element
          }

          div, span {
            // property: value; for the div & span element
          }
  4. ways to use css:
    inline, internal, external

    inline:
      using style attribute on any element/tag

    internal:
      1. using style tag in the head element
      2. using css selector to style any element/tag

    External Styling:
      using external stylesheet for styling
  
  5. prorities:

      priority Order:

        Inline > (Internal | External )
        
        Internal vs External ( Order Of Execution Latest line style will be applied )

    Overriding the Priority of the Styling:
      use of !important
  
  6. display property:
      inline:
        occupies only the width that is needed for the content

        applying width & height property has no effect with inline display

      block:
        occupies the entire width of the parent

        applying width&height will have an effect on its content, but still occupies the entire & does not allow other elements sit along side its
        Means other elements will appear from next line

      inline-block:
        applying width&height will have an effect on its content

        also allows other elements to sit alongside

    display: none; 
      removes the element from the DOM/Elements Tree that is displayed for the User
    
    visibility: hidden;
      hides the element in the DOM/Elements Tree that is displaed to the user

  7. Selections:

    tag selection
      h1 { // applies only for h1
        font-family: monospace;
        color: blue !important;
      }

      table, td { // applies for tables & td
        border: 1px solid;
      }

    class or id:

      class:
        .<class-name> {
          // styles
        }

        Eg:
          .div-styles {
            color: yellowgreen;
          }

        single class can be used for multiple elements

      id:
        #<id> {
          // styles
        }

        Eg:
          #div-one {
            color: red;
          }

          #div-two {
            color: lightcoral;
          }
        
        ** every element should have unique id **

    specificity: class vs id

      id based styling will have the first preference
